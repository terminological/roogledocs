## CRAN notes justifications

* This project contains a Java library and R code generated by the (r6-generator maven plugin)[https://github.com/terminological/r6-generator].
This generates wrapper R6 code, documentation, DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE files, along with supporting files such as this cran-comments.md, 
github workflows. If there are specific issues with the way these files are generated please could you raise issues on the r6-generator project on the link above
so they can be fixed for all future projects.

* All Java library code and its transitive dependencies have already been bundled into a single binary (JAR file) which is part of
the package. This minimises the complexity of getting a java library up and running on a target
system. However bunding java libraries does tend to make the package quite large, and will often exceed the 5Mb CRAN limit. The whole of the JAR file 
will have to be updated and re-installed for every change to the R package, however this is the most stable option with fewest dependencies on the target system.
For certain situations, where dependencies are not publicly available, for example, this is the only option.

* The R6 package is a build time dependency. The note that it is unused can be safely ignored.

* This is a new release.
