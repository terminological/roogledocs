Description: Programmatically substitute images, data and tables into a google doc or presentation. R library to perform limited interactions with google docs and slides in R via the Java API library. The purpose being to support google docs as a platform for interactive development and documentation of data analysis in R for scientific publication, although it is not limited to this purpose. The workflow supported is a parallel documentation and analysis where a team of people are working collaboratively on documentation, whilst at the same time analysis is being performed and results updated repeatedly as a result of new data. In this environment updating numeric results, tabular data and figures in word documents manually becomes annoying. With roogledocs you can automate this a bit like a RMarkdown document, but with the added benefit that the content can be updated independently of the analysis, by the wider team.
