Health AI research has demonstrated some impressive results,5–10 but its clinical value has not yet been realised, hindered partly by a lack of a clear understanding of how to quantify benefit or ensure patient safety, and increasing concerns about the ethical and medico-legal impact.11 

This analysis is written with the dual aim of helping clinical safety professionals to critically appraise current medical AI research from a quality and safety perspective, and supporting research and development in AI by highlighting some of the clinical safety questions that must be considered if medical application of these exciting technologies is to be successful.

Clinical decision support systems (DSS) are in widespread use in medicine and have had most impact providing guidance on the safe prescription of medicines,12 guideline adherence, simple risk screening13 or prognostic scoring.14 These systems use predefined rules, which have predictable behaviour and are usually shown to reduce clinical error,12 although sometimes inadvertently introduce safety issues themselves.15 16 Rules-based systems have also been developed to address diagnostic uncertainty17–19 …}, note={tex.ids= Challen2019-yj

B.1.1.7 was monitored in the UK through routine testing and S-gene target failures (SGTF), comprising over 90% of cases by March 2021. Now, the reverse is occurring: SGTF cases are being replaced by an S-gene positive variant, which we associate with B.1.617.2. Evidence from the characteristics of S-gene positive cases demonstrates that, following importation, B.1.617.2 is transmitted locally, growing at a rate higher than B.1.1.7 and a doubling time between 5-14 days. S-gene positive cases should be prioritised for sequencing and aggressive control in any countries in which this variant is newly detected.</p>}, note={Citation Key: challen2021}, publisher={Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press}, author={Challen, Robert and Dyson, Louise and Overton, Christopher E. and Guzman-Rincon, Laura M. and Hill, Edward M. and Stage, Helena B. and Brooks-Pollock, Ellen and Pellis, Lorenzo and Scarabel, Francesca and Pascall, David J. and Blomquist, Paula and Tildesley, Michael and Williamson, Daniel and Siegert, Stefan and Xiong, Xiaoyu and Youngman, Ben and Juniper and Read, Jonathan M. and Gog, Julia R. and Keeling, Matthew J. and Danon, Leon}, year={2021}, month=jun, language={en} }
